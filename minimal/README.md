# Minimal MacGyver Logo
This logo is suitable for single-color applications, where a coat of arms or crest would be too much.

## Inspiration and Design
The minimal MacGyver Session logo is based on the OSHWA Open Source Hardware logo. The stripes on it are taken from the logo of the Phoenix Foundation, MacGyver's employer in later seasons of the show:

The text is in Routed Gothic.
