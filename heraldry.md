# MacGyver Coat of Arms
The MacGyver coat of arms contains several elements inspired by the show and open hardware principles. It uses Wikimedia files from the [Wikipedia Heraldry Portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Heraldry), so you can remix it according to heraldic rules to make your own version if you wish.
