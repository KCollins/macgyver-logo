# MacGyver Coat of Arms
The MacGyver coat of arms contains several elements inspired by the show and open hardware principles. It uses Wikimedia files from the [Wikipedia Heraldry Portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Heraldry), so you can remix it according to heraldic rules to make your own version if you wish. There are many SVG assets available there. Note that there is a distinction between a crest and a coat of arms: the coat of arms is what goes on the shield, and the crest has other elements, including scrolls, supporters, etc.

## Design Inspirations
The basic shape is the [Blason vide](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blason_vide_472x565.svg), which is a fairly standard shape for a coat of arms. 
It's also consistent with [Scottish](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_Kingdom_of_Scotland.svg) style, as befits MacGyver. (The producers started out wanting to name the character "Guy" but found it too obvious; they were also inspired by the success of the "Mc" in "McDonalds." Of course, the [Scots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASPWh7cAQ4E) are renowned for their engineering prowess.) There are recognized [McIver arms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_MacIver), which are denoted "quarterly or and gules, a bend sable" in the [~14th century programmming language](https://drawshield.net/tutorial/00-intro.html) used to describe arms.

## Remixing
Heraldry is filled with [remixing and adaptation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impalement_(heraldry)). You are encouraged to adapt these assets to make your own version of a MacGyver crest.
The assets in this folder are intended for Adobe Illustrator, but tools like [coamaker.com](https://www.coamaker.com) and [drawshield.net](https://www.drawshield.net) are also great for brainstorming and creating your own.
